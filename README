When added to an update zip this should allow any HTC device with a custom recovery to flash kernels.

Requirements:
-The devices must have a working kernel and ramdisk that starts either /system/bin/app_process or /system/bin/netd.
-Both /system and /data should be mounted for rw before using install_kernel.sh.
-install_kernel.sh is passed file names that must match the files used by the edify scripts
-The included files must be packaged in and extracted to an otherwise unused directory; the default is /tmp/kernel/, but this can be changed in the updater-script.
-The data partition must have enough free space to fit four copies of the boot partition. (approx. 32MB to 64MB)

Included Files
-updater-script.txt contains the commands used with the edify script
-install_kernel.sh is ran by the updater-script and either installs the boot.img or installs the flashboot binary and shell
-flashboot replaces /system/bin/app_process and /system/bin/netd, and is called during boot by the devices init scripts
-flashboot.sh is executed by flashboot and installs the new boot.img
-busybox is used by both install_kernel.sh and flashboot.sh
